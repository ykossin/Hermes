# Hermes

Hermes is an Apollo-derived Linux game-streaming host focused on making
Moonlight/Hestia streaming less manual and more reliable on CachyOS/Arch,
with low-latency real virtual displays through Hermes-KMS.

Hermes-KMS is a purpose-built DRM/KMS virtual display driver that streams the
compositor's scanout straight into the hardware encoder as a DMA-BUF, with no
CPU readback. It is the default backend because it avoids the GPU→RAM→GPU copy
that EVDI does, which lowers latency. EVDI is still fully supported and can be
selected at any time — both backends work. (Measured capture cost on KWin at
720p: ~8 us/frame on Hermes-KMS vs ~180 us/frame for EVDI's CPU copy, and
constant regardless of resolution.)

Hermes keeps protocol compatibility with Sunshine, Moonlight, Artemis, and
Hestia. The normal GameStream/Sunshine flow remains the fallback path, while
Hestia can use Hermes protocol extensions when the host reports support for
them. The product is branded Hermes throughout the UI, but the protocol lineage
identifier stays `Apollo` so existing Artemis/Hestia clients keep working
unchanged.

## Compatibility and support

Hermes is developed on **CachyOS with KDE Plasma (Wayland) on AMD**, because
that is the maintainer's daily system and the only configuration that is
continuously exercised. Other distributions, compositors and GPUs are supported
as far as their code paths allow, and are improved as problems get reported —
keeping several of each verified is not something one person can do alone.

[docs/compatibility.md](docs/compatibility.md) records the current state
honestly: what has actually been tested and how, what shares a verified code
path but has never been run, what is known broken, and the limitations worth
knowing before you file a bug. It covers KDE, COSMIC, GNOME, wlroots,
Hyprland and gamescope, the AMD/Intel/NVIDIA encoder paths, and the Hermes-KMS
and EVDI backends.

**Hyprland works through its own headless output, not a virtual DRM device.**
Its aquamarine backend requires every DRM device with an output to host its own
GL renderer, which a virtual display cannot do, so Hermes-KMS and EVDI are both
unusable there. Hermes asks Hyprland for a headless output instead, which it
renders on the primary GPU — see
[docs/compatibility.md](docs/compatibility.md#hyprland--verified-through-its-own-headless-output).

**Issues and pull requests are very welcome**, including reports that something
simply works — those are what move an entry from "expected to work" to
"verified".

## Current focus

- Create and activate a real virtual display. Hermes-KMS is the default for
  its lower latency; EVDI is a fully supported alternative and the automatic
  choice where Hermes-KMS is unavailable.
- Make the compositor actually render into the virtual display, through
  whichever interface it offers: KScreen on KWin, wlr-output-management on the
  wlroots family, or Mutter's DisplayConfig on GNOME — where exclusive mode and
  mirroring now work as well.
- Avoid falling back silently to the physical monitor when virtual-display
  setup fails.
- Report missing host dependencies and diagnostics clearly.
- Keep Gamescope optional. Gamescope is useful for a SteamOS-like session, but
  Hermes should only use it when enabled by app configuration, settings, or an
  explicit Hestia request.

## Hestia protocol support

Hermes exposes Hestia protocol v1 endpoints under:

```http
/api/hestia/v1
```

Important endpoints include:

- `GET /api/hestia/v1/capabilities`
- `POST /api/hestia/v1/session/prepare`
- `POST /api/hestia/v1/session/stop`
- `GET /api/hestia/v1/diagnostics`
- `GET /api/hestia/v1/clipboard`
- `POST /api/hestia/v1/clipboard`

Clients should gate enhanced behavior on the capabilities response. If the
Hestia API is unavailable, clients should continue through the normal
Moonlight/Sunshine flow.

## Clients

- **Android:** Artemis (ClassicOldSong's Moonlight fork) — the reference client.
- **Desktop:** Hestia — <https://github.com/MrOz59/Hestia>. No binary release
  yet; build from source. Hestia is the client tuned to Hermes' protocol
  extensions; generic Moonlight clients also work through the standard flow.

The web UI (`https://<host>:47990`) is branded Hermes. Set the displayed server
name under *Configuration → General → Server Name*; it defaults to the PC's
hostname.

## Virtual display behavior

Hermes tries to create and connect a virtual display for virtual-display
sessions before launching the configured app, selected by the
`virtual_display_backend` setting (`hermes_kms` or `evdi`).

### Hermes-KMS (preferred, zero-copy)

The compositor owns the virtual card and scans out the desktop; Hermes opens the
Hermes-KMS render node and pulls each frame as a DMA-BUF, which a real GPU
imports and encodes. On Linux/KDE Wayland this depends on:

- the `hermes_kms` kernel module loaded with `initial_enabled=0`, leaving its
  connector disconnected until Hermes owns it for a stream, and its card left
  on the active seat;
- `kscreen-doctor` (KWin) or a Wayland output-management protocol to enable the
  virtual output;
- a real GPU render node (e.g. amdgpu) for VAAPI encoding;
- a session where the Hermes process can access the user compositor environment.

The unreleased branch has two distinct opt-in experiments:

- `hermes_kms_multi_output = true` gives simultaneous clients separate outputs
  and capture pipelines, but those outputs still belong to the same host
  desktop/compositor session. It requires Hermes-KMS UAPI 8 or newer, loaded
  with enough outputs:

```bash
sudo modprobe hermes_kms initial_enabled=0 outputs=2
```

- `hermes_kms_isolated_sessions = true` is the independent-session prototype.
  **It is under re-evaluation and is not recommended.** It will change in ways
  that are not backwards compatible, so a setup built on it now is likely to
  need rebuilding, and several things are known to be unfinished: a session
  composites in software rather than on the GPU, nothing bounds what a session
  may consume, a session given a Unix account of its own still hears the host's
  audio, and Remote Input is disabled. A full desktop and simultaneous real
  clients have not been validated. What follows describes what is built, not a
  feature that is ready to use.

  One Hermes server starts a separate compositor, application process tree,
  capture path, and tagged virtual input set for each client. Application
  profiles run directly in a DRM Gamescope session; desktop profiles run Weston
  with its desktop shell and panel, or another compositor named by
  `hermes_kms_session_compositor`. It requires a Hermes-KMS driver at UAPI v11
  or newer — released drivers are older, so this means a 0.4.x development
  build — with one independent DRM card per client:

```bash
sudo modprobe hermes_kms initial_enabled=0 devices=2 outputs=1
```

The isolated prototype also requires the driver's session-seat udev rule,
`gamescope`, `weston`, and one private seat broker per device. For the
two-device example, install `seatd`, add the Hermes user to the `seat` group,
and start:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now hermes-kms-seatd@1.service hermes-kms-seatd@2.service
```

Hermes selects `/run/hermes-kms-seatd/N/seatd.sock` for device `N`; it will
reject an isolated launch with an actionable log message if that broker is not
available. The brokers are experimental process/session plumbing, not a
security boundary for mutually untrusted local users. Per-session audio, a
full Plasma desktop, and real concurrent Moonlight clients have not been
validated yet. Both experiments default to off; the existing single-output
path remains the default. If both experimental flags are present,
`hermes_kms_isolated_sessions` takes precedence and shared-desktop
multi-output management stays inactive.

The input-only/Remote Input application is intentionally unavailable in this
mode because it has no compositor session that identifies which private seat
should receive its events.

The repository includes `scripts/vm-isolated-input-test.sh`, which uses a
disposable virtme-ng guest to create two real uinput keyboards and verify that
the packaged udev rules assign them to `hermes-kms-1` and `hermes-kms-2`
without modifying host rules.

#### Installing the Hermes-KMS driver

Hermes-KMS is an out-of-tree kernel module distributed via DKMS, so it rebuilds
automatically for every kernel update (the same way `evdi-dkms` works). The
source lives at <https://github.com/MrOz59/Hermes-KMS>.

> **Build it from the driver's `main` branch.** Hermes requires UAPI v11 or
> newer from the module and refuses an older device with
> `UAPI <n> is too old` in the log. The driver's last tagged release, 0.3.2, is
> below that floor; `main` (0.4.x) is not, and is what the commands below build.

**Option A — DKMS from a clone** (any distro with `dkms` and kernel headers):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrOz59/Hermes-KMS.git
cd Hermes-KMS
sudo make dkms-install        # registers + builds + installs via DKMS
sudo modprobe hermes_kms initial_enabled=0
```

The build auto-detects whether your kernel was built with clang (e.g. CachyOS)
or gcc, so no extra flags are needed. To load it automatically on every boot,
install the module-load drop-in and keep the connector initially disconnected:

```bash
sudo install -Dm644 packaging/modules-load.d/hermes-kms.conf /etc/modules-load.d/hermes-kms.conf
printf '%s\n' 'options hermes_kms initial_enabled=0' | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/hermes-kms.conf
```

To remove it:

```bash
sudo make dkms-uninstall
```

**Option B — Arch/CachyOS package** (builds and installs via DKMS, with boot
auto-load drop-ins included):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrOz59/Hermes-KMS.git
cd Hermes-KMS
makepkg -si
```

Older Hermes-KMS packages wrote `initial_enabled=1` to
`/etc/modprobe.d/hermes-kms.conf`. Change that option to `0` before rebooting;
Hermes also disconnects this legacy unowned output at startup so an upgrade can
recover without requiring the old package to be removed first.

Verify the module is loaded and a Hermes render node exists:

```bash
lsmod | grep hermes_kms
ls /dev/dri/by-path/ | grep hermes   # expect platform-hermes-kms-render -> ../renderD*
```

Do **not** install the driver's development seat-ignore udev rule for normal
streaming — it stops KWin/GNOME from adopting the output. That rule is only for
isolated `modetest` driver testing. See the driver repository for build internals
and the zero-copy validation tooling.

### EVDI (supported alternative)

EVDI remains a fully supported backend — set `virtual_display_backend = evdi`
to use it, or Hermes selects it automatically when Hermes-KMS is unavailable. It
depends on:

- `evdi` / `evdi-dkms`
- `libevdi`
- `kscreen-doctor`
- a session where the Hermes process can access the user compositor environment

`evdi` is an **optional** dependency, not a build requirement: it lives in the
AUR (not the official repos), so the package no longer lists it under `depends`
and `makepkg -si` builds without it. Install it yourself only if you want the
EVDI virtual-display backend:

```bash
paru -S evdi        # or: yay -S evdi
```

The Audio/Video settings tab shows a live diagnostic and step-by-step install
guide when either virtual-display driver (EVDI or Hermes-KMS) is missing.

Gamescope is not required for either virtual-display path. If installed,
Hermes exposes an optional `Gamescope Steam Session` app entry that runs Steam
Big Picture inside Gamescope on top of the virtual display.

## Installing

Every push to `main` refreshes the rolling **nightly** prerelease, and a tagged
version publishes a normal release, both at
<https://github.com/MrOz59/Hermes/releases>. CI builds these Linux packages:

| Distribution | Asset | Installs |
|:-------------|:------|:---------|
| Arch / CachyOS | `hermes-streaming-<version>-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst` | `sudo pacman -U ./hermes-streaming-*.pkg.tar.zst` |
| Ubuntu 24.04, 26.04 | `hermes_<version>_ubuntu<release>_amd64.deb` | `sudo apt install ./hermes_<version>_ubuntu<release>_amd64.deb` |
| Fedora 43, 44 | `hermes-<version>-1.fc<release>.x86_64.rpm` | `sudo dnf install ./hermes-<version>-1.fc<release>.x86_64.rpm` |

Match the release in the filename to the one you run: a `.deb` or `.rpm` is
built inside that release's own container, so its dependencies are the sonames
that release ships and it will refuse to install on another. Arch and CachyOS
are the configuration Hermes is developed on; the others are built in CI and not
exercised as a desktop — see [docs/compatibility.md](docs/compatibility.md).

Every package installs the binary as `/usr/bin/hermes` and a `hermes.service`
systemd **user** unit:

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now hermes
```

The nightly packages are rebuilt on every push and may be unstable. There is no
repository to subscribe to yet, so upgrading means downloading the newer asset.
The virtual display also needs the [Hermes-KMS](https://github.com/MrOz59/Hermes-KMS)
kernel module, which is installed separately — see
[Installing the Hermes-KMS driver](#installing-the-hermes-kms-driver) above.

## CachyOS/Arch package build

From the repository root:

```bash
makepkg -sf
```

If the host already has all build dependencies installed and `makepkg -s` is
blocked by local dependency metadata, a local developer build can use:

```bash
makepkg --nodeps -sf
```

Install the generated package with:

```bash
sudo pacman -U ./hermes-streaming-*.pkg.tar.zst
```

The Arch package is named `hermes-streaming` because the `hermes` name belongs
to an unrelated PAM authentication project in the AUR. Upgrading from an older
Hermes package replaces only the old `hermes` package versions below `0.5.0`.
The application paths remain `/usr/bin/hermes`, `/usr/share/hermes`, and the
`hermes.service` systemd user unit, so it can still be installed **side by side
with the `apollo` (AUR) and `sunshine` packages**. Start it with:

When migrating from an older package named `hermes`, pacman will ask to remove
that conflicting package as part of the transaction; accept the removal. User
configuration is not package-owned and remains in place — which also means
uninstalling Hermes does not clear your Web UI password. Do not install the
unrelated `hermes` package offered by AUR helpers.

Installed side by side means installed, not running side by side: Hermes,
Apollo, and Sunshine all bind ports 47984/47989/47990, so start only one of
them at a time. Whichever starts second fails to bind and exits, which shows up
in the browser as `Failed to fetch` on the login page.

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now hermes
```

Protocol and client compatibility is unchanged: Hermes keeps the same Artemis
protocol extensions, so existing Artemis/Hestia clients keep working.

## Container / image-based distributions (Bazzite, Silverblue, SteamOS)

Image-based distributions keep `/usr` read-only, so there is no point at which
a package lands on the installed system and the normal install does not apply.
`packaging/container` holds a runtime image that runs Hermes on a headless sway
session with audio, XWayland and an optional Steam Big Picture session, so only
the kernel module has to exist on the host:

```bash
cd packaging/container
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

The virtual display still comes from the
[Hermes-KMS](https://github.com/MrOz59/Hermes-KMS) module on the host. For an
image-based host, build it into the image with that repository's
`packaging/bazzite/Containerfile` — DKMS cannot work there. Without the module
the container falls back to a software backend and gives up the zero-copy path.

This image serves **one** session, so it does not compose with
`hermes_kms_multi_output` or `hermes_kms_isolated_sessions`; several clients
means one container each. See `packaging/container/README.md`.

Adapted from [SOVLOOKUP/hermes-sunshine](https://github.com/SOVLOOKUP/hermes-sunshine),
contributed upstream by its author.

Note that `docker/` at the repository root is unrelated: those are Sunshine's
*build* images and produce no runnable host.

## Notes

- **Configuration location.** Hermes stores everything in `~/.config/hermes`
  (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hermes`): `hermes.conf`, `hermes_state.json` (Web UI
  credentials and paired clients), `apps.json`, and `hermes.log`. Releases
  before this one used `~/.config/sunshine`, shared with Apollo and Sunshine; on
  first start Hermes copies that directory across and leaves the original in
  place for them. To reset a forgotten Web UI password, stop the service and run
  `hermes --creds <username> <password>` — this keeps your paired clients,
  whereas deleting `hermes_state.json` unpairs them.
- **Address family / web UI reachability.** The server binds dual-stack by
  default (`address_family = both`). On distros where `localhost` resolves to
  IPv6 (`::1`) first, an IPv4-only bind makes the web UI fail intermittently
  with "Failed to fetch"; dual-stack avoids that. Override under
  *Configuration → Network → Address Family* if you need IPv4-only.
- **Isolated virtual display.** With `isolated_virtual_display_option` enabled,
  the physical monitor is turned off only once a streaming session actually
  starts (and restored when it ends), not when the virtual display is created.

## Credits

Hermes builds on work from:

- ClassicOldSong's Apollo project, which established the Apollo host direction
  and Moonlight compatibility model.
- Sgtmetalmex's Apollo-CachyOS fork, whose EVDI/KDE/Gamescope patch series
  identified and fixed several Linux virtual-display issues that are important
  for Hermes stability:
  - EVDI device-index discovery.
  - KScreen/KWin virtual-output activation.
  - avoiding DRM master conflicts on EVDI cards.
  - hotplugged EVDI capture fallback.
  - EVDI CPU-buffer capture and event pumping.
  - physical-monitor recovery safety work.
  - optional Gamescope Steam Session integration.
- SOVLOOKUP's hermes-sunshine, the container image in `packaging/container` that
  runs Hermes on a headless sway session, contributed upstream by its author.
  The same work identified a race in Hermes' own virtual-output activation,
  which is now fixed here.
